												<h3>J&K and Ladakh</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Jammu and Kashmir is a region administered by India as a union territory, and constituting the southern portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947, and between India and China since 1962. The region of Jammu and Kashmir is separated by the Line of Control from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north respectively. It lies to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh, which is also subject to the dispute as a part of Kashmir, and administered by India as a union territory.</p>

												<h3>Beauty of J&K</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is a great tourist destination. Picturesque and enchanting, Kashmir is cradled high in the lofty green Himalayas and hailed all over the world for its incredible natural beauty. Surrounded by mountain peaks, lush green valleys, glistening lakes, temples and spectacular Mughal-era gardens, it has inspired poets through centuries. Kashmir is crisscrossed by chinar tree-lined roads and quaint wooden bridges; and is home to bustling bazaars, sufi shrines and forts. Add to this, the charms of flavourful Kashmiri cuisine and apples and walnuts from the lush orchards surrounding it.
 
In winter, Kashmir takes on a white glow, covered in soft snow and skiers making a beeline for its famous slopes. And in summer, as the snow melts, and the flowers in the meadows bloom, it resembles an artist's canvas.
 
Meanwhile, Jammu lies on the banks of the pristine Tapi river. It is dotted with hundreds of temples. From the popular Hindu pilgrimage of Vaishno Devi, which is located nearby, to scores of religious structures set in picturesque surroundings, Jammu is the ideal site to set on a temple trail and soak in spiritual vibes.</p>
