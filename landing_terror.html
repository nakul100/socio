This not only stops by over looking but also some interactive activites like bomb blast also. Jammu and Kashmir DGP  Dilbag Singh on Saturday accused Pakistan of trying to infiltrate terrorists in J&K. The DGP also said that Pakistan is trying to promote terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir by providing support to terror outfits.“Pakistan is trying to promote terrorism in every possible way in Jammu & Kashmir by providing all support to terror groups.

											<p>New Delhi: A new terror group in Kashmir, which security forces say is just a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba, has used body cameras for the first time to capture and release footage of its attacks on security forces. 

The People’s Anti-Fascist Front has released body-cam footage of two terrorists attacking security forces at Baramulla district on 17 August.

The attack had led to the death of two troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and a special police officer (SPO) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police.

With the video surfacing, Jammu and Kashmir Police tweeted saying the terrorists wanted to glamourise terrorism. The police added that they had responded to the attack by killing four “top commanders”, including the person seen in the video footage. </p>

"As a result, 138 terrorists have been neutralised in Jammu and Kashmir from March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020. During this period of six months, 50 security force personnel have attained martyrdom in terrorist-related incidents and ceasefire violations, cross border firings in Jammu and Kashmir," he said replying to a written question.
