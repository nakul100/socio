										<h2>Socio-economic view in JK</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Jammu and Kashmir has become a Union territory with its own legislature. One of the stated reasons for bifurcating the erstwhile state into two UTs is the lack of economic and social development. The economic growth of the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been erratic in the past few years. State GDP growth rate has fluctuated between 3.2 per cent to 17.7 per cent in a matter of just two years, according to RBI data. The volatility is common for all major sectors of the economy such as industry, banking, construction, manufacturing, and agriculture.</p>

												<h3>J&K economy in a nutshell</h3>
											</header>
											<p>With a 56 per cent share, the service sector constitutes most of J&K’s economy. Other two major sectors constituting the state economy are industry at 27.8 per cent and agriculture at 16 per cent. The tourism sector plays an important role in the state’s economy. The sector has huge potential for employment generation, even for unskilled manpower.
Tourism also caters to the allied sectors like handicrafts, handlooms, and transport. Despite the state’s unique and rich culture and heritage assets, the tourism sector accounts for only around 6.98% of the state’s GDP. Tourism in J&K is not even among the top 10 domestic destinations in the country on the basis of the number of tourist arrivals.</p>

												<h3>Militancy menace</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The erratic growth of Jammu and Kashmir can be attributed to the armed militancy in Kashmir valley in the past decade. The economy is also marked by low productivity in agriculture and allied sectors that have affected employment generation and growth in per capita income. Also, poor infrastructure has resulted in the undeveloped industrial sector. A lack of well-defined strategy, good governance, and sound fiscal management have further affected economic growth in the state.</p>
